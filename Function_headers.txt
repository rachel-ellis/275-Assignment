Manhattan
/* 
Description: The function calculated the Manhattan distance between 2 points
Arguments: const Point& pt1, and const Point& pt2, these are const refernces to
the struct that stores a point. This includes the longitude and latitude
information. 
Return: the distance or cost to get from one point to another. This is of 
type long long. 
*/
Dijkstra
/*
Description: this function computes the least cost of paths that strat at a 
specfic vertex. Funcitons from binary heap are used for the implementation

Arguments: Const refernce to an instance of WDiagraph,int startVertex - this
vertex is considered as the root of the serach tree by this function, tree
is of type unordered map and it stores the two vertices and the cost of their
edge. It is used to construct the least cost path to a certian vertex.

Return: none
