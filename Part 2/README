Assignment 1 Part 2 â€” Trivial Navigation System


We did the Assignment with some help from TAs during office hours but other than that we received no other help.

Included Files :
Makefile 
README
client directory
	clent.cpp
server directory
	digraph.h
	edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
	digraph.cpp
	server.cpp
	heap.h
	dijkstra.cpp
	dijkstra.h

plotter
link_emulator


Makefile Targets:
- make server: Builds the project. And directs the data from the edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt to make the graph. 
It futher opens three terminals, one to run the server.cpp file one to run the client.cpp and the third one runs
the plotter 
- make clean : Removes all object files and executables .

Running Instructions :
1. Call make all from the terimal if running the file for the first time. As specifed in the assignment description, 
the points to plot are specified in the file and the output must be redirected to the plotter. 
The user must call the excutable ./client and then using proper pipleline to recieve input from the appropriate input file and
redirect the output via the sockets to the server.cpp file.
2. otherwise start by calling make clean and then make all after that all files and 
executables should be called by the Makefile 
3. Ensure the inpipe and the outpie have been removed before running the program again 

Notes and Assumptions : 
The zip file contains the client directory, server directory, README, Makefile. plotter, link_emulator.In this part of the
assignment we made changes to the server.cpp and client.cpp in the server and client directories respectively. In the server.cpp, 
we based our code off of echoserver.cpp to implement revceing and sending information from the socket.Futhermore, in client.cpp, 
we implemented methods to receive the points from the plotter and then send it to the server.cpp by using sockets . Also, it is 
important to note that we are the using original version of plotter relased. The program assumes that the point passed in by the plotter
will have the correct format and type.
